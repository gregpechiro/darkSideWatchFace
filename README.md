Android Wear Dark Side of the Moon watch face
=============================================

This is my first watch face. It is a digital watch with a Dark Side of the Moon theme.

It also displays the current Unix time stamp in seconds. The watch face has 4 complication placements.

It was built off of the Google watch face code lab found [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/watchface/index.html#0).
I also used the Google complications code lab found [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/complications/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#0) for the complications.
